## Schema Design for Audit Events

The audit event schema is defined in the `auditLog` table within the Drizzle ORM schema. This table captures comprehensive information about system events for compliance, security, and operational monitoring purposes.

### Core Fields

The `auditLog` table includes the following essential fields:

- **id**: Serial primary key for the log entry
- **timestamp**: Timestamp with timezone (stored as string), not null, representing when the event occurred
- **action**: Varchar(255), not null, describing the action performed (e.g., 'user.login', 'document.update')
- **status**: Varchar(50), not null, with type constraint to `AuditEventStatus` ('attempt', 'success', 'failure')
- **principalId**: Varchar(255), optional identifier of the user or system that initiated the action
- **organizationId**: Varchar(255), optional identifier for multi-tenancy support
- **targetResourceType**: Varchar(255), optional type of resource affected by the action
- **targetResourceId**: Varchar(255), optional identifier of the specific resource affected
- **outcomeDescription**: Text field for detailed description of the outcome
- **details**: JSONB field to store any additional properties as structured or unstructured data
- **ttl**: Varchar(255), optional time-to-live information
- **hash**: Varchar(64), cryptographic hash (SHA-256) for ensuring data immutability
- **dataClassification**: Varchar(20), with type constraint to `DataClassification` ('PUBLIC', 'INTERNAL', 'CONFIDENTIAL', 'PHI')
- **retentionPolicy**: Varchar(50), indicating the retention policy applied to this event
- **correlationId**: Varchar(255), for tracing related events across systems
- **processingLatency**: Integer, recording processing time in milliseconds
- **archivedAt**: Timestamp with timezone, indicating when the event was archived

## Partitioning Strategy

The audit log system implements a time-based partitioning strategy to optimize performance and manageability of large datasets.

### Partitioning Implementation

The `audit_log` table is partitioned using range partitioning on the `timestamp` column with monthly intervals. Each partition follows the naming convention `audit_log_YYYY_MM` (e.g., `audit_log_2025_08`, `audit_log_2025_09`).

The partitioning setup can be initialized through two methods:

1. **Fresh Database Setup**: Using the `pnpm audit-db:setup-partitions` script or directly executing `node scripts/setup-partitions.js` with a database URL.
2. **Migration of Existing Data**: Applying the `convert-to-partitioned.sql` migration script to convert an existing non-partitioned table.

### Automatic Partition Management

The system includes automated partition management features:

- **Auto-creation**: Partitions are automatically created for the current month plus six months ahead
- **Auto-cleanup**: Old partitions are dropped based on configured retention policies
- **Monitoring**: Built-in functions to analyze partition statistics and health

```mermaid
flowchart TD
Start([Monthly Partition Management]) --> CheckCurrentMonth["Check if current month partition exists"]
CheckCurrentMonth --> |No| CreateCurrent["Create partition for current month"]
CheckCurrentMonth --> |Yes| CheckFuture["Check if next 6 months partitions exist"]
CheckFuture --> |No| CreateFuture["Create partitions for next 6 months"]
CheckFuture --> |Yes| CheckRetention["Check retention policy"]
CheckRetention --> |Expired| DropPartition["Drop expired partitions"]
CheckRetention --> |Not Expired| End([Management Complete])
CreateCurrent --> CreateFuture
CreateFuture --> CheckRetention
```

## Connection Pooling and Resource Utilization

The database persistence mechanism employs an enhanced connection pooling strategy to efficiently manage database resources and support high-throughput operations.

### Connection Pool Configuration

The `EnhancedConnectionPool` class manages database connections with configurable parameters:

- **minConnections**: Minimum number of connections to maintain in the pool
- **maxConnections**: Maximum number of connections allowed in the pool
- **idleTimeout**: Time in milliseconds before idle connections are closed
- **acquireTimeout**: Time in milliseconds to wait for a connection before timing out
- **retryAttempts**: Number of retry attempts for failed connection acquisitions
- **retryDelay**: Delay in milliseconds between retry attempts
- **ssl**: Boolean flag to enable SSL connections

### Connection Pool Implementation

The connection pool is implemented using `postgres.js` as the underlying PostgreSQL client, integrated with Drizzle ORM. Key features include:

- **Connection Monitoring**: Tracks connection statistics including total, active, and idle connections
- **Performance Metrics**: Measures connection acquisition time and maintains rolling averages
- **Health Checking**: Provides a health check endpoint that verifies connectivity with a simple `SELECT 1` query
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Properly closes all connections when the application terminates

```mermaid
classDiagram
class EnhancedConnectionPool {
-client : Sql
-db : PostgresJsDatabase
-stats : ConnectionPoolStats
+getDatabase() : PostgresJsDatabase
+getClient() : Sql
+executeQuery(queryFn) : Promise~T~
+healthCheck() : Promise~HealthResult~
+getStats() : ConnectionPoolStats
+close() : Promise~void~
}
class EnhancedDatabaseClient {
-connectionPool : EnhancedConnectionPool
-queryCache : IQueryCache
+getDatabase() : PostgresJsDatabase
+executeQuery(queryFn, cacheKey, cacheTTL) : Promise~T~
+executeQueryUncached(queryFn) : Promise~T~
+getStats() : Stats
+healthCheck() : Promise~HealthResult~
+close() : Promise~void~
}
EnhancedDatabaseClient --> EnhancedConnectionPool : "uses"
```

## Indexes and Query Optimization

The audit database schema includes a comprehensive indexing strategy to optimize query performance for common access patterns.

### Primary Indexes

The following single-column indexes are created on frequently queried fields:

- `audit_log_timestamp_idx` on `timestamp`
- `audit_log_principal_id_idx` on `principalId`
- `audit_log_organization_id_idx` on `organizationId`
- `audit_log_action_idx` on `action`
- `audit_log_status_idx` on `status`
- `audit_log_target_resource_type_idx` on `targetResourceType`
- `audit_log_target_resource_id_idx` on `targetResourceId`
- `audit_log_correlation_id_idx` on `correlationId`
- `audit_log_data_classification_idx` on `dataClassification`
- `audit_log_retention_policy_idx` on `retentionPolicy`

### Composite Indexes

To optimize common query patterns, the following composite indexes are implemented:

- `audit_log_timestamp_status_idx` on `(timestamp, status)` - for time-range queries filtered by status
- `audit_log_principal_action_idx` on `(principalId, action)` - for user activity analysis
- `audit_log_classification_retention_idx` on `(dataClassification, retentionPolicy)` - for compliance queries
- `audit_log_resource_type_id_idx` on `(targetResourceType, targetResourceId)` - for resource-specific audit trails

```mermaid

## Transactional Integrity and Batch Operations

The database persistence mechanism ensures transactional integrity during audit event insertion, particularly for batch operations.

### Transaction Management

While the provided code does not explicitly show transaction management for batch inserts, Drizzle ORM supports transactional operations. A typical implementation for batch inserts would use:

```typescript
await db.transaction(async (tx) => {
  for (const event of events) {
    await tx.insert(auditLog).values(event);
  }
});
```

This ensures that either all events in a batch are successfully inserted, or none are, maintaining data consistency.

### Bulk Operations Optimization

For high-throughput write operations, the system is designed to handle bulk inserts efficiently through:

- **Connection Pooling**: Reusing database connections to minimize connection overhead
- **Prepared Statements**: Although disabled in the current configuration for better connection reuse, they could be enabled for specific high-frequency queries
- **Batch Processing**: While not explicitly shown, the architecture supports batch operations through the ORM's bulk insert capabilities

The combination of connection pooling and efficient query execution allows the system to handle high volumes of audit events with minimal latency.

## Performance Monitoring and Optimization

The audit database includes comprehensive performance monitoring and optimization capabilities to maintain high performance under load.

### Performance Testing Insights

Based on the implementation, the system includes performance monitoring features that track:

- **Query Latency**: Execution time of database queries
- **Connection Acquisition Time**: Time to obtain a connection from the pool
- **Memory Usage**: Heap memory consumption during query execution
- **Cache Hit Ratio**: Effectiveness of query caching

The `executeMonitoredQuery` method in the enhanced client captures these metrics and logs slow queries that exceed a configurable threshold.

### Optimization Features

The system implements several optimization strategies:

- **Automatic Performance Reporting**: Generates performance reports at regular intervals (every 5 minutes)
- **Auto-optimization**: Performs automatic optimizations based on performance metrics, such as clearing cache when hit ratio is low
- **Maintenance Operations**: Runs database maintenance tasks like vacuum and analyze
- **Configuration Optimization**: Suggests optimal database configuration settings
