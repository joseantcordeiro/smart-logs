# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Smart Logs Audit System

## 1. Introduction

**Product Name:** Smart Logs Audit System  
**Objective:** To provide a robust, secure, and compliant audit logging system specifically designed for healthcare applications. This system will ensure that applications meet regulatory requirements such as HIPAA and GDPR, while providing developers with a reliable and easy-to-use solution.

## 2. Target Audience

**Primary Users:** Developers building healthcare applications that handle sensitive patient data.  
**Secondary Users:** Compliance officers and auditors who need to review audit trails.

## 3. User Problems & Goals

**Problem:** Healthcare application developers need a straightforward way to implement comprehensive audit logging that meets strict regulatory standards. Existing solutions may be too generic, not secure enough, or lack features specific to the healthcare domain.  
**Goal:** Enable developers to easily integrate a compliant audit logging system, allowing them to focus on their application's core functionality. The system should be reliable, secure, and provide clear, actionable audit trails.

## 4. Features & Requirements

### 4.1. Core Functionality: Audit Logging

- **FR1.1:** The system must be able to log audit events from various sources within a healthcare application.
- **FR1.2:** Events should be processed reliably, with guaranteed delivery.
- **FR1.3:** The system should include a mechanism for handling failed events, such as a dead-letter queue.
- **FR1.4:** Automatic retry mechanisms with exponential backoff should be implemented for transient failures.

### 4.2. Security & Compliance

- **FR2.1:** All audit logs must be protected against tampering. This will be achieved through cryptographic integrity verification using SHA-256 hashing and HMAC signatures.
- **FR2.2:** The system must be GDPR compliant, with features for data classification and configurable data retention policies.
- **FR2.3:** Input data must be automatically sanitized to prevent security vulnerabilities like injection attacks.
- **FR2.4:** The system must generate HIPAA-compliant audit trails.

### 4.3. Healthcare-Specific Features

- **FR3.1:** The system must support logging of audit events related to FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources).
- **FR3.2:** It should be possible to track and log events related to practitioner license verification.
- **FR3.3:** The system must provide detailed logging of access to patient data, including who accessed the data, when, and for what purpose.

### 4.4. Monitoring & Observability

- **FR4.1:** The system must provide real-time health checks and expose key performance metrics.
- **FR4.2:** Performance monitoring, including latency tracking for audit event processing, is required.
- **FR4.3:** The system should provide monitoring for queue depth to ensure timely processing of audit events.
- **FR4.4:** Comprehensive error handling and logging must be in place to diagnose and resolve issues quickly.

### 4.5. Technology Stack

- **FR5.1:** The backend will be built with Hono and tRPC, Rest API, Graphql on Node.js for a lightweight and type-safe API.
- **FR5.2:** The frontend will be a web application built with React and TanStack Router.
- **FR5.3:** A mobile application will be developed using React Native and Expo.
- **FR5.4:** The database will be PostgreSQL, with Drizzle as the ORM.
- **FR5.5:** User authentication will be handled via email and password using Better Auth.
- **FR5.6:** The project will be structured as a monorepo using Turborepo.

## 5. Out of Scope

- This PRD does not cover features beyond audit logging, such as real-time application monitoring or user analytics.
- Direct integration with specific Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems is not in the initial scope but may be considered for future versions.
